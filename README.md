# Flutter Voice Assistant App


 ## Overview
I developed a Voice Assistant app using Flutter and Dart that leverages the power of OpenAI API's Chat GPT and DALL-E models to provide advanced conversational and image generation capabilities. The project aimed to create an interactive voice-based interface for the users to obtain answers to their queries and generate custom images, without specifying which option they need to opt for.

## Goals
### 1. Develop a Voice Assistant app: 
The primary goal of the project was to create a Voice Assistant app that allows users to interact with the application using voice commands. This app aimed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to obtain information and perform tasks through voice-based interactions
### 2. To integrate Chat GPT for conversational capabilities and DALL-E for image generation: 
The goal was to provide accurate responses to user queries, understanding natural language inputs, and generating relevant and informative answers and to allow users to generate custom images by describing their preferences or providing specific instructions, enhancing the visual experience of the Voice Assistant app.
